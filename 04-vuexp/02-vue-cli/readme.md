1. We can locally register a component inside another component(most preferred) or globally include it in the main.js file. 
2. Install sass - npm install node-sass sass-loader --save-dev
3. Send data to child component with props. We can't mutate parent properties inside child component with props. But with event emitter we can do that. 
4. Slots: to pass html(forms) from parent to child component.
